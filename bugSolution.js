To fix this issue, enable offline persistence in your Firebase Realtime Database. This will ensure that data is cached locally and synced when a connection is available.

```javascript
//Enable Offline Persistence
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.database().goOffline(); // added this line
firebase.database().ref('/myData').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  const data = snapshot.val();
  // ... process data ...
});
firebase.database().goOnline(); //added this line
```

Remember to enable offline persistence in your Firebase project's settings as well.  This involves setting the persistence option to 'local'.  Additionally, ensure you properly handle any potential errors that may occur during offline persistence operations.  Always test thoroughly after implementing the solution.
